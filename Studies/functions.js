/**
 * 
 * 0. Functions in javascript are like procedures that take in an input and based
 * on that input outputs something diffrent that we use to make our code more effective and efficent.
 * 
 * 1. to create a function we start with our function definition then the name of our function.
 * followed by the parameters and code block. ex: function name () {//does a cool thing}.
 * the parameters
 * 
 * 2. we can also use a variable initalization for our functions assignment. so instead of having function name () {}
 * we can declare our variable first then assign it to our function like so. var name = function () {} 
 * using arrow functions is also an option. instead of using the function definition we define it as such (() => {})()
 * this would also be a IIFE or Imediatly Invoked Function Expression due to the () at the end of our (() => {})

/**
CONTROL FLOW

control flow in javascript is the order in which the computer executes statements in our code

when we run our code the computer reads it in order from first line in the file to the last line.
unless the computer runs across structures that change the control flow like loop and conditionals.

for example windows operation systems are constantly running on a loop. in this loop is a conditional that
checks if the user has selected shutdown/restart. if so that is when a shutdown function runs which would close all unesential programs and end itself
shutting down windows for the computer and ending the control flow

that is to put it very simply but control flow in javascript can be changed constently depending on how the program is created
within the scope of loops and conditinals

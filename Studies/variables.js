/**
 * VARIABLES
 * 
 * 0. Variables hold things in memory to be used later in the life-cycle of the program.
 * variables are named identifiers that can point to values of particular type, 
 * like numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects or another data-type.
 * variables are called so because once created we can change the value to anyother data-type. 
 * 
 * 1. to create a variable we can use the 3 diffrent types of keywords. 
 * var, let, and const. then we assing a name after the keyword. then we assign the variable to our data-type of choice
 *
 * 
 * 2. there are 2 phases of using variables: declaration and initialization (or assignment)
 * 
 * declaration is when we create a variable without any initialization.
 *  ex: var name; 
 * console.log(name) // prints => undefined
 * 
 * initilization is when we give a variable a data-type to store.
 *  ex: var name = "sidney"; 
 * console.log(name) // prints => "sidney"
 * 
 * reassingment is when we reassign a already exsisting varible into something different.
 * with var and let you can reassign them, but const is a constant variable. meaning it cant be reassigned

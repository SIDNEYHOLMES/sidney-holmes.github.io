/**
LOOPS   
loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly

. loops in javascript come in a couple different ways
    for loops reapeat until a specific condition is met. in this case if i is equal to the length of the array
    var arr = [1, 2, 3]
    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        console.log(array[i])
    }
    // 1
    // 2
    // 3
 

 do while loops repetes until a certin condition evaluates to false
the statment will alwayse be executed at least once

    let i = 0;
do {
  i += 1; // statement
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 5);
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

ex:
let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
